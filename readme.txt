Geco is a lightweight application for managing orienteering races.
It is written in Java and designed to be cross-platform (please report if you find platform issues).

Geco UI is designed to provide a lean user experience: navigate through stage workflow using the top tabs, and access data by direct manipulation.

Geco is also geared towards the Orient'Show format:
- it provides advanced functions to explain MPs and count penalties (including butterfly miss);
- it manages knockout qualifications.

----------
Install: unzip the archive file (should be done already if you can read this file).

Geco runs with Java version 6 and above. It might run with Java version 5.
You can download a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) from http://www.java.com

You need the SPORTIdent drivers to read SI cards.
– Windows: download available at http://www.sportident.com/
– Linux: recent kernels recognize the chip used by SI station, so it’s plug’n’play.
– Mac OS X: it's possible to install and tweak a USB driver to get Mac OS X to recognize the station. See the FAQ in the documentation.

Launch: double-click on the jar file.

----------
User documentation available under the help/ folder in html format.

If you are experienced with orienteering softwares, you can jump-start using the application without the doc.
Geco UI is designed to be very usable (with some room for improvements): almost any actions available is visible, data accessible through direct manipulation, no hidden menus, no complicated workflow.
