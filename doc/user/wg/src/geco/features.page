# Features

Geco currently supports the SPORTident timing system.

The three following formats are currently available:

- Classic (inline course): controls must be taken in order
- Free Order: runner chooses in which order to take the controls
- Orient'Show: time penalties and MP limit, knockout qualifications,...

Free Order and Orient'Show support the following options when checking e-cards:

- time penalties on missing punches
- MP limit, from 0 MP allowed to any number of MP

Geco offers powerful capabilities for ecard reading:

- three reading [modes](../guide/ecard_modes.html): racing, training, registration
- an [automatic handler](../workflows/auto.html) which provides:
  - automatically insert new entries when reading ecards
  - detect the course from the punch trace in ecard
  - look up ecard number in archive to retrieve name, club, category...

These features enables different [organisation styles](../workflows/index.html) with Geco, from lighweight training to medium-size race.

Geco UI is organized as a series of panels in tabs, each dedicated to one aspect of the race.

- [Stage] to configure stage, clubs, courses, categories
  - import course from the IOF XML format
  - change SPORTident parameters
- [Runners] to register competitors and manage issues during the race
  - register runners in CSV file or using an archive
  - get a detailed view of race data for each runner, including trace of punches
  - manage special cases using the merge dialog
- [Log] to get race statistics and perform batch operations
- [Results] to generate rankings and splits
  - export results in HTML, CSV, and XML formats, with multiple options
  - automatically export results for live update
  - French National Ranking calculator
- [Heats] to generate heats from results for the next stage in knockout qualifications (Orient'Show format only)

Read the [UI Guide] for documentation about each panel.

- management of parallel pools and knockout qualifications
