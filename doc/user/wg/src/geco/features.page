# Features
Geco window is organized as series of tabbed panels, each panel dedicated to one aspect of race management. So here are the features, panel-wise:
- Sportident station management (always accessible)
- [Stage] management, to create and modify stage configuration, clubs, courses, categories
- [Runners] management, to look at registered runners, filter data, check punches, and modify runner's status for the race
- [Live] panel, to follow SI download and get race statistics
- [Results] panel, to generate results
- [Heats] panel, to generate heats from results for the next stage

Read the [UI Guide] for a description of each panel.
