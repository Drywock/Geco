# Features

Geco currently supports the Sportident timing system.


Geco UI is organized as a series of tabbed panels, each panel dedicated to one aspect of race management. So here are the features, panel-wise:
- Toolbar supports creating/loading/navigating between stages
- [Stage] management, to configure stage, clubs, courses, categories
  - import course from the IOF XML format
  - change Orient'Show parameters
- [Runners] management, to look at registered runners, filter data, check punches, and modify runner's status for the race
  - follow the race in live 
  - get trace explanation about any runner
  - manage special cases using the merge dialog
- [Results] panel, to generate results
  - automatically export results for live update
- [Heats] panel, to generate heats from results for the next stage
- [Log] panel, to get race statistics

Read the [UI Guide] for a description of each panel.


Geco presents some features dedicated to Orient'Show:
- time penalties and MP threshold
- accurate count of MPs and detailed trace
- management of knockout qualifications
