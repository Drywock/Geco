# Features

Geco currently supports the Sportident timing system.

Geco presents some features dedicated to Orient'Show:
- time penalties and MP limit
- accurate count of MPs and detailed trace
- management of knockout qualifications


Geco UI is organized as a series of panels in tabs, each dedicated to one aspect of the race.

- [Stage] to configure stage, clubs, courses, categories
  - import course from the IOF XML format
  - change Orient'Show parameters
- [Runners] to look at registered runners, filter data, check punches, and modify runner's status for the race
  - follow the race in live 
  - get trace explanation about any runner
  - manage special cases using the merge dialog
- [Results] to generate results
  - export results in html and csv formats, with multiple options
  - automatically export results for live update
- [Heats] to generate heats from results for the next stage in knockout qualifications
- [Log] to get race statistics

Read the [UI Guide] for documentation about each panel.
