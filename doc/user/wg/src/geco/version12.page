# Version 1.2 'Preview'

Since the 1.1 release, there have been some major internal work in Geco to prepare the future.
Such changes may not look important at first sight, however they are significant and we feel
that providing a release would enable early field-testing by users to detect unforeseen problems.
For this reason, the 1.2 release is labelled as a 'preview': we feel confident it is working well,
however it is not as well tested as the 1.1. So be careful with your data.

Here is the list of visible changes:

- Geco now explicitly handles the different formats of orienteering races: in particular it adapts the UI to each format (config options, custom tabs...).
Current formats include Classic inline and Orient'Show. Free Order stages are coming soon.
- New launch wizard which enables to either open an existing stage (from an history of recent stages) or creates a new one for a given format.
- ecard number is no longer required and can be left empty.
- First german translation by Philipp Walker.
- Some other minor changes in the UI.

Other information:

- Change in data file format: Geco 1.2 will automatically convert 1.1 stage files to the new format.
Meaning also that Geco 1.1 can't load a 1.2 stage (use stage backups to be safe!).
- Documentation not updated.
- LiveMap temporarily disabled.
