# Geco
<div class="intro">...is a lightweight desktop application in Java to manage orienteering race in live. Geco was developed to support the Orient’Show format. However, it works fine with classical formats of orienteering (and can be extended).</div>

## Philosophy
Geco has three driving forces.
- Custom application for the Orient’Show format, which has a number of peculiarities (rules and format) not well supported by other apps. But geco also supports classical formats out of the box, and leans towards an extensible platform for any format of orienteering.
- Enhanced user experience through simple UI guidelines: in Geco, all data and possible actions are visible through the main panes and easily accessible, making obvious how to interact with the application. Very few capabilities are not visible at first hand.
- Extensible by and for the open-source community: because it's time for everybody to get some good tools for our geeky sport.
