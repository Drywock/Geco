# Geco
<div class="intro">...is a lightweight desktop application in Java to manage orienteering race in live. Geco was developed to support the Orient’Show format. However, it works fine with standard orienteering events.</div>

## Philosophy
Geco has three driving forces.
- Customization for the **Orient’Show** format, which has a number of peculiarities (rules and format) not well supported by other apps. But Geco also supports classical formats out of the box, and leans towards an extensible platform for any format of orienteering.
- Enhanced **user experience** through simple UI guidelines: Geco favors direct accessibility and manipulation of data through visible panels and actions, making obvious how to interact with the application. Very few capabilities are not visible at first hand.
- Extensible by and for the **open-source** community, because it's time for everybody to get some good tools for our geeky sport.
