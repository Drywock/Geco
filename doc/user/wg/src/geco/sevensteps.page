# Seven Steps to manage an O' event with Geco

Here is a quick guide to discover the essential features of Geco: seven steps to handle the computerized organization of an orienteering event. Read on for starters. For an overview of different organisation styles, read the [workflows](../workflows/index.html) section.

1\. Use the [Launcher] and the [Stage] panel to set up a new stage.

2\. Load courses from within the [Stage] panel.

3\. Register competitors from the [Runners] panel and using the [Archive].

4\. Check E-card configuration in the [Stage] panel and click the Reader button in the [Toolbar].

> Runners download their e-card in the reader to check their status and get their split times.

4bis. Resolve problems directly in the [Runners] panel and using the [Merge] dialog (read [Auto handler](../workflows/auto.html) to get a better a picture of manual vs auto handler).

5\. Print intermediate [Results].

6\. Don't forget to check [unresolved statuses](../workflows/endstage.html) to see if everyone is finished.

7\. Generate final [Results] for publishing and analysis.
