# Requirements

What do you need to run Geco?
- A recent JRE (Java Runtime Environment, version 6+)
- Geco bundle: it includes the application (jar file), template files for a race, user documentation, native libraries for serial communication (RXTX)
- SportIdent drivers 
  - Windows: check sportident website
  - Linux: recent kernels recognize the chip used by SI station, so it's plug'n'play
  - Mac OS X: nothing out of the box, but it is easy to install some driver and get Mac OS to recognize the station (one line to hack). Contact me for the process

To launch Geco, **execute the geco.jar file**. It should opens automatically if your JRE is correctly configured.

## RXTX library
In some cases, you may need to install and compile RXTX drivers (serial drivers for the Java platform). Contact me if you need some help.
