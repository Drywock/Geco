# Create parallel pools for qualifications

*Experimental feature*

1. Create one stage per pool (each runner has to run in each pool)
1. Create a merging stage to merge all pool results
  1. it should define a `pools.prop` file listing all pool stages to merge
  1. it should define [heatsets](../guide/heats.html) to qualify runners based on merged results
1. Once pools are finished, run pool merger on the merging stage directory with `java -jar gecoXXX.jar valmo.geco.GecoPools <MergingStageDirectory>`
1. the batch run generates files `merged_results.html` and `heat_startlists.csv` for the first stage in the knockout series

Notice that only runners having OK results in all pools can be qualified. See *hellemmes\_poolmerge* in the demo samples for an example of merging stage.


# Create a series of stages for qualifications

1. Create one stage for each step of the qualification (quarter-finals, semi-finals, finals, ...)
1. Put all stage folders in the same parent folder
1. Create a file named `stages.prop` in the parent folder
1. Open `stages.prop` and write stage folder names in order (from first quals to finals), one per line

Content of `stages.prop` for the above example (where hellemmes\_df would be semi-finals and hellemmes\_f finals):  
  `hellemmes_df`  
  `hellemmes_f`
