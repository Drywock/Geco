# Create a series of stages for qualifications

1. Create one stage for each step of the qualification (quarter-finals, semi-finals, finals, ...)
1. Put all stage folders in the same parent folder
1. Create a file named `stages.prop` in the parent folder
1. Open `stages.prop` and write stage folder names in order (from first quals to finals), one per line

Content of `stages.prop` for the above example (where belfield would be the first stage and mullaghmeen the last):  
  `belfield`  
  `belfield2`  
  `mullaghmeen`
