# LiveMap and Animation

The toolbar contains two buttons dedicated to live analysis and animation of the race.

The *magnifier* opens the **LiveMap**, a dedicated visualization which provides an easy way to understand traces. The *antenna* opens a dialog to start broadcasting card read to a **GecoLive** server.

*Please note these are still experimental features.*


## LiveMap for on-the-fly visualization and analysis

**LiveMap** complements the trace as it offers an intuitive visualization of missing and added punches on the map. Even in complex cases (involving butterfly loops), the two tools together allows one to understand errors in the race.

Once the view is opened, selecting a runner in the **Runners Panel** will display his trace.
OK punches are shown in magenta. Missed punches and legs are shown in red and dashed lines. Added punches not on course are shown in blue and cyan.

Configuration:
1. load a map image
1. load a course file in XML format

It is recommended to export both files from OCAD. There are known problems with other programs.

Adjusting map and controls:
1. click the *Adjust* button in the Map Parameters to start the calibration process
1. click a control on the map (it should appear as the *Centered Control* in the panel)
1. click on map to indicate the new position for the control - it should translate all controls
1. click another control (preferably far away from the centered control)
1. click on map to indicate the new position for the control - it should scale all controls so that centered control stays on position and second control is on its new position

At any time, you can stop the calibration by clicking again on the *Adjust* button. For example, click on it after step 3 to just translate all controls, without scaling them.

If you need to fine-tune the calibration, you can always play with the manual parameters but this can be tricky.

You can then check controls or courses with the last buttons.

Don't forget to *save* parameters once you are satisfied! Geco will create a `live.prop` in the stage directory so that parameters gets loaded automatically. You can reuse the file on any computer using LiveMap or GecoLive for this stage.


## GecoLive for animation

**GecoLive** is an application dedicated to animation: it can show the trace of a runner as soon as he downloads his E-card in Geco. The speaker can also browse other runners. GecoLive can reside on a different computer and receive data over the network.

Configuration:
1. launch **GecoLive** from the command line with `java -jar gecoXXX.jar valmo.geco.live.GecoLive`
1. start the GecoLive server by clicking the *Listen* button in the bottom left corner (check the port number)

Multiple **Geco** instances can push data to **GecoLive**:
1. open the live dialog by pushing the *antenna* button
1. give the proper hostname and port number where GecoLive is running
1. press ok, broadcasting is starting

You can always interrupt broadcasting by clicking again the button.

Further configuration:
- **Geco** only pushes card reading events and not other changes affecting results; as a consequence, **GecoLive** is not a reliable mean to get results: it just displays traces.
- to display **results** to the speaker, run a web server and use the [autoexport](../guide/results.html) feature from the **Results Panel**.
