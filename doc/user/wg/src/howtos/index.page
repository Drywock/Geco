# Workflow in auto mode

<img src="../images/autoworkflow.png" />

The schema illustrates the four outcomes of reading an e-card in auto mode. On each wing, there are the fully automatic ways:
- on the left wing, normal way for pre-registered entries.
- on the right wing, normal way for on-the-fly registration with archive.

In the middle, unresolved cases which require manual intervention:
- middle left is duplicate status. It can happen simply if you ask the competitor to read again the e-card, or if a new competitor runs with a previously used e-card
- middle right is unknown status. The competitor may have followed onsite registration with a rented e-card and is completely unknown to the system (that is, until now). Or the competitor is pre-registered, or in the archive, but his real e-card does not match either because of a typo or because he recently changed it.

Depending on the case, you can edit, delete, merge the new entry to resolve the case. If you choose to keep and edit the new entry, don't forget to recheck or change the official status (ok, mp). You can also print splits for the competitor.
