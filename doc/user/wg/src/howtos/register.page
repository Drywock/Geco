# Fill in mass registrations

Whenever you have to perform mass pre-registration for a stage, it is possible to work with your own spreadsheet application.
The folder `data/template` provides some data files with basic samples for clubs, categories, courses, and runners. 
Copying the content of this folder into a new folder is a simple way to create a new stage.

Editing `Clubs.csv` and `Classes.csv` (categories) is straightforward.

To create courses in `Courses.csv`:
- one course per line
- the first line `Course name, distance, elevation, Cross Country,1,1001,60,10,36000000,,,, Control 1, Control2, Control 3, ...` shows what is expected in each field. **Remove it** before saving the file
- a sample course description looks like `Course A, 5.5, 100, Cross Country,1,1001,60,10,36000000,,,,31,32,33`
- if possible, it is better and less error-prone to import courses from Geco in XML format

To register runners in `Competitors.csv`:
- one runner per line
- the first line `startnumber; e-card; firstname; lastname; club; course; rented?; category; registered starttime;; 1; NC?; archive; 0;` shows what is expected in each field. **Remove it** before saving the file
- sample runner description: `1; 10000; John; Doe; ClubName1; Course A;false;M21;;;1;false;;0;`
- give a unique `startnumber` and `si number` to avoid problems
- give `club`, `course`, and `category` names which match those declared in above files
- `registered starttime` should be given with format h:mm:ss, relative to the zero hour of the competition
- `rented?` field is either `true` or `false`
- `NC?` field is either `true` or `false` (`false` in most cases)
