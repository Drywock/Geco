# Results Panel

The results panel can generate results from current data at any time during a race.

## Computing results

1\. Select either *Courses* or *Categories* i.e., the kind of pools with which to compute results. A manual selection of courses (categories) can be performed in the list below.

The *Category/Courses* is a third option which computes one ranking per category in each course. It is useful when categories are split across different courses in pools.

2\. Select either *Ranking*, *Splits*, or *CN* to set up the kind of results to compute.
- Ranking: classic ranking, can be used to compute intermediate or official results.
- Splits: split times for all runners in selected pools.
- CN: simulator of french [CN](http://cn.ffco.asso.fr) (national ranking).

By default, results display runners with OK status, as well as runners with status MP, DNF, DSQ. Courses/categories for which no data are available are not displayed.
Options for displaying results include:
- *NC*: include runners ticked as NC in the results. They will appear after the ranked runners, with MPs and related.
- *Others*: include DNS runners or without race data.
- *Penalties*: show real race time and number of MPs for each runner (only ranking).
- *Empty sets*: show all courses (categories) in results, even if there is no data yet.

Results can be displayed in the right panel (*Refresh* button), printed, or exported in an external file. The default export format is HTML.

### Export format

Geco proposes three formats for file export:
- **HTML** for web publication
- **CSV** for spreadsheets
- **OE CSV**, which is recognized by many analysis applications

For example for RouteGadget, select *Splits* and *OE CSV*.

For French CN, select *Ranking* or *CN* and *OE CSV*. The resulting file will be much smaller.

### CN simulator

The CN simulator computes scores for competitors from the FFCO. You can use this function to check that data are ok for publication. Use the *OE CSV* checkbox in the export file dialog.

Check the correctness of archive ids to ensure ok results! Best way to do it is simply to use archive import or CSV import.

## Auto mode (results)

The *Auto* button, when on (pressed), repeatedly refreshes results or generates a result file called `lastresults` in the data folder with the interval specified (in seconds) in the textfield at the right.
The auto feature takes into account parameters specified when the button is pressed (selected courses or categories, ranking/splits/CN, export format, options).
Stop then start again auto mode to take into account new parameters.
