# Results Panel

The results panel can generate results from current data at any time during a race.

<a href="../images/results_panel.png"><img src="../images/results_panel.png" /></a>

Select either *Courses* or *Categories* to compute results. A manual selection of courses (categories) can be performed in the list below.

The *Category/Courses* is a third option which computes one ranking per category in each course. It is useful when categories are split across different courses in pools.

By default, results display the ranking of runners with OK status, as well as runners with status MP, DNF, DSQ. Courses/categories for which no race data are available yet are not displayed.
Options for displaying results include:
- *Show NC*: include runners ticked as NC in the results. They will appear after the ranked runners, with MPs and others.
- *Show others*: include DNS runners, which were registered but did not run.
- *Show penalties*: show real race time and number of MPs for each runner.
- *Show empty sets*: show all courses (categories) in results, even if there is no race data yet.

Results can be displayed in the right panel (*Refresh* button), printed, or exported in an external file using either **html** or **csv** format. The default export format is html.

The *Autoexport* button, when on (pressed), repeatedly refreshes results or generates a result file called `lastresults` in the data folder with the interval specified (in seconds) in the textfield at the right.
The autoexport feature takes into account parameters specified when the button is pressed (selected courses or categories, export format, *Show NC*,...).
Stop then start again autoexport to take into account new parameters.
