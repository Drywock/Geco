# Functions (Log Panel)

Functions are special purpose operations which can be performed on batch of data, usually runners. They allow one to change/check data in registry at once.

Select the tab *Functions* next to Stats in the [Log](log.html) panel and choose a function in the combo box. Each function displays its set of parameters and actions in the top pane. Pressing *Execute* performs the default operation of the function.

Currently available functions:

**Set start times**
- Change registered start times at once for the selected pool of runners (by course, category, or an arbitrary set); can be use to mimic a mass start if necessary
- Only change the start time of runners without race data (i.e. Not Started runners); tick *Reset all runners...* to change start time for all runners, including those with race data

**Recheck runners**  
Recheck all runners in the selected pool (by course, category, or an arbitrary set); a more fine-grained version of *Recheck OK|MP* in the toolbar

**Random Generator**
- Generate random entries (complete with e-card) to test Geco behavior
- Additional action to generate an unknown entry (test manual vs auto mode)
- Additional action to generate e-card data for an existing entry (possibly generating a duplicate in auto mode)
