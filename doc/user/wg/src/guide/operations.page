# Operations

Operations can be performed on batch of data, usually runners. They allow one to change/check data in registry at once.

There are three groups (tabs) of operations next to Stats in the Operations panel. Select a tab and then choose a operation in the combobox. Each operation displays its set of parameters and actions in the top pane. Pressing *Execute* runs the operation.

- *Stage* operations are commonly performed during stage
- *Referee* operations serve referee purposes
- *Batch* operations deal with less common operations


## Stage Operations

### Set Start Times
- Change registered start times at once for the selected pool of runners (by course, category, or an arbitrary set); can be use to mimic a mass start if necessary
- Only change the start time of runners without race data (i.e. Not Started runners); tick *Reset all runners...* to change start time for all runners, including those with race data

### Check Station Log
- Read ecard logs to automatically set remaining *Not Started* entries as either *Running* or *DNS*
- Ecard logs can be read and exported from **stations memory** by Si-config
- You can choose to insert unregistered ecards from archive (in case some late runners completely bypassed registration - at least you will know they are in forest)
- Tick *Simulate* to see what would Geco do with the given data

There are two important gotchas when using this operation:

- Station memories should be erased before the stage, otherwise logs would give inconsistent data
- Be sure to read all logs (for example all erase stations) before ticking the *Mark DNS* option, so that you don't miss some running ecards


## Referee Operations

### Referee Log
- Display/write a log for the referee with all manual changes having an impact on results, like status change or time change


## Batch Operations

### Import Ecard Log
- Import an ecard log with punch data to handle a stage "post-mortem": Geco behaves as if ecards were read live, either in training or racing mode (including course detection, archive lookup)
- Especially useful for light training events, since all operations can be performed after the fact at home, to provide results
- One just needs to read all ecards with Si-config during the event in order to export the log

### Recheck Runners
Recheck all runners in the selected pool (by course, category, or an arbitrary set); a more fine-grained version of *Recheck OK|MP* in the toolbar

### Delete Data
- Reset some/all stage data to start afresh
- Geco performs a save/backup before the operation
- Can also perform some cleanup with old backups

### Random Generator
- Generate random entries (complete with ecard data) to test Geco behavior
- Additional action to generate an unknown entry (test manual vs auto mode)
- Additional action to generate ecard data for an existing entry (to test duplicate entries)
