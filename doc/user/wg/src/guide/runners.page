# Runners Panel

The runners panel is the central place to manage runners data before and during the event.

Quick access through `modifier + R`.

(Click to zoom in)

The main part of the panel is the table, which lets you view/edit/filter/sort runners with all the important data.
The right pane displays either complementary information about the currently selected runner (like the list of punches), or statistics about the race.


## Runners Table

- Double-click in a cell to start edition
- *Add/Remove Runner:* add a runner at the end of the startlist; remove the currently selected runner
- *Sort Runners:* click on a header cell of the table to sort runners according to ascending/descending rank
- *Filter Runners:* start typing to display only entries matching your search (the search is performed full-text and matches substring in data)
- *Auto Mode (tickbox):* in this mode, Geco does not open the *Merge dialog* when reading an unknown or duplicate E-card. Instead, it creates a new runner and try to guess the course (*Experimental* feature, the course guessing is very naive). You can then edit the new entry
- *Live Mode (tickbox):* in this mode, Geco automatically focuses on the last data received from the card reader; runners are dynamically sorted by order of card reading, with most recent on top (other sort options disabled)
- *Fast edit Mode (tickbox):* start edition with just one click, useful when lots of edition have to be done quickly

The table is good for registration/modification on the fly during the event. See [Registrations](../howtos/register.html) for some advice about mass registration.

- Geco checks that the values you enter in the table are valid
- Information/problems are displayed in the status bar (and in the log for the most important ones)
- Changing the course triggers a status computation to check if the trace is still valid
- If necessary, the official race time (used for results) can be edited by hand
- If necessary, status can be changed manually
  - Unknown: runner registered but no race data available - runner may still be racing
  - OK
  - MP: Missing Punch
  - DNS: Did Not Start
  - DNF: Did Not Finish
  - DSQ: Disqualified
  
### Keyboard navigation
Geco defines some keybindings to enhance quick navigation in the data.
- `tab` navigates between widgets
- `space` starts edition in the table, `enter` to validate (`space` or `tab` work too), `esc` to cancel edition
- `modifier + F` puts focus in the `Find:` field to filter entries (modifier is the `Control` or `Command` key, depending on your platform)
- `Esc` cancels the filter

## Runner Data Pane

The *Runner Data* pane shows complementary information about the currently selected runner. It is useful for an analysis of runner race when resolving a problem. In particular, Geco is able to accurately detect and display *missing punches* in the trace view.

- The *Race* field always displays *finish - start* time, not taking into account time penalties nor the official race time which may have been edited by hand
- Time fields display colors to highlight potential problems:
  - A **pale red background** in the *Erace/Control/Start/Finish* indicates that no time could be read from the E-card
  - A **yellow background** in the *Race* field indicates that the official time in the table does not match race time + penalties. This happens when the official time has been edited by hand
- Some reset buttons can restore computed values after manual modification
  - *Reset Time* computes the official race time based on race time and penalties
  - *Recheck* computes the status based on punches and course and reset the time
  - global action *Recheck OK|MP* resets manual modification on official time to runners with OK or MP status, be careful!
- Click the *Merge...* button for advanced management of data, like merging two runners together. It opens the *[Merge dialog](merge.html)* on the currently selected runner.


### Trace
The trace pane displays the list of controls for the course compared with the list of punches (control code and punch time) of the runner. It is of great help to understand where a runner mispunched. Geco uses a sophisticated algorithm to detect accurately mispunches, even in the case of butterfly loop:

- a missing control is displayed in red with a **-** sign in front
- a supplementary control is displayed in blue with a **+** sign in front
- in some cases, the control is displayed in red as **-X+Y**: this is a mispunch which can be explained as a substitution, the runner took control Y instead of X
- it is also easy to spot inversion in the shape of **-X, Y, +X**: the runner took Y before X, while he should have go the other way.

## Statistics Pane
See the [Log](log.html) page for a description of stage statistics.
