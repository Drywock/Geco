## General
- Zero hour: used for older SI cards V5 and registered start times
- Runner archive: path to [archive](archive.html)
- CN base: path to score file for the [french CN](results.html) (national ranking), exported as [CSV](http://cn.ffcorientation.fr/classement)

## SI Reader
- Station port: *SPORTident master station must be connected before launching the app so that Geco can detect the port*
- Split format: multi-columns (see `SplitNbColumns` in `geco.prop`) or ticket (single column, best for thermal printer)

## Penalties (only for Orient'Show, Free Order, ...)
- MP limit: number of missing punches authorized before marking the runner as MP
- Don't check MP limit: runner can have any number of missing punches without ever being MP (disable MP limit)
- Time penalty: time penalty per missing punch, in seconds (also displayed in minutes for large time penalty)

## Course
- Geco can import courses described with the *[IOF XML](http://www.soenniksen.dk/iof-datastandard/index.shtml)* format. Click the *XML* button to select the course file
- You can *Edit* the course sequence by hand, if necessary
- You can *Recheck* all runners from a course after a change
  
## Category
- Course column: set the default course for runners in the category (used when importing registrations from file or from archive)
- You can import a CSV *Template* file describing common categories and their default courses. See `data/modeles` for some sample files following french rules. Each line describes a category as `short name, long name, course name`

Data for clubs, categories, courses can also be edited with a spreadsheet application. See [File Formats](../howtos/fileformat.html).
