# Log Panel

The log panel displays a journal of important events since the beginning of session. It also shows statistics for the stage and give access to [Functions](functions.html).
To see all events captured since the stage was created, scan the `geco.log` file.

The statistics pane displays the number of runners per status for each course as well as for the total. There are three views for statistics :

- *Summary* to see the essential information during the stage
- *Unresolved* to only see status to resolve before the end of stage
- *Results* to see the detailed statistics after the stage

The *summary* displays the following status :

- Present: runners who ran or are running (all registered minus DNS)
- Unresolved: entries which require your attention, especially when dealing with [End of Stage](../workflows/endstage.html); Not Started, Running, Unknown, and Duplicate statuses are all considered unresolved
- Not Started: runners registered but without race data for now. Toward the end of stage, mark them either as Running or Did Not Start
- Finished: runners with race data and resolved, including DNF, DSQ, etc.
- OK
- MP: a high number of MPs early in the stage might indicate a problem with course settings (in Geco or on terrain)

The *unresolved* view shows:

- Unresolved: totalling the next four statuses; the stage is not finished as long as this state is not zero
- Not Started: registered runners without race data
- Running: runners explicitly marked as running but who did not read their ecard yet
- Unknown: ecard read without a corresponding entry
- Duplicate: ecard read multiple times

The *results* view shows:

- Registered: all runners in the registry, including presents and DNS
- DNS runners
- Finished: after the stage, this equals the number of present runners
- OK, MP, DNF, DSQ, and OOT runners

The statistics updates automatically every 10 seconds. You can press the *Refresh* button to manually update the statistics.
