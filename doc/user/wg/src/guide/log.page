# Log Panel

The log panel is a journal of important events since the beginning of session. It also shows statistics for the stage.
To see all events captured since the stage was created, scan the `geco.log` file.

The statistics pane displays status of runners for each course as well as the total.
There is a short listing with most important numbers, and a long listing of statistics, enabled through the *Short view* tickbox.

When the *Short view* mode is on, the following status are displayed:
- Present: runners who ran or are running the stage
- Unknown: runners without race data for now. They might still be running, or they might be absent (you should mark such people as DNS)
- Finished: runners having some race data. Hence, Present = Unknown + Finished
- OK: runners who finished
- MP: a high number of MPs early in the stage might indicate a problem with course settings (in Geco or on terrain)

When the *Short view* is off, the long listing displays more numbers:
- Registered: runners in the database, including Present + DNS
- DNS, DNF, DSQ runners
- Finished = OK + MP + DNF + DSQ

The statistics updates automatically every 10 seconds. You can press the *Refresh* button to manually update the statistics.
