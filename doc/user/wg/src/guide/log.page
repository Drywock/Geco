# Log Panel

The log panel displays a journal of important events since the beginning of session. It also shows statistics for the stage and give access to [Functions](functions.html).
To see all events captured since the stage was created, scan the `geco.log` file.

The statistics pane displays status of runners for each course as well as the total.
There is a short listing with most important numbers, and a long listing of statistics, triggered by the *Short view* tickbox.

When the *Short view* mode is on, the following status are displayed:
- Present: runners who ran or are running
- Unresolved: entries which require your attention, especially when dealing with [End of Stage](../howtos/endstage.html); Not Started, Running, Unknown, and Duplicate statuses are all considered unresolved (in other words, the race is not finished as long as there are entries with these statuses)
- Not Started: runners registered but without race data for now. They might be running (you can mark them as Running) or they might be absent (mark them as DNS)
- Finished: runners having some race data, Finished = OK + MP + DNF + DSQ. Hence, Present = Unknown + Finished
- OK: runners who finished
- MP: a high number of MPs early in the stage might indicate a problem with course settings (in Geco or on terrain)

When the *Short view* is off, the long listing displays more numbers:
- Registered: all runners in the database, including Present + DNS
- Running: runners marked as still running (and missing)
- DNS, DNF, DSQ runners
- Unknown: e-card data downloaded in [auto] mode without a known competitor (to be resolved)
- Duplicate: e-card data downloaded more than once in [auto] mode (to be resolved)

The statistics updates automatically every 10 seconds. You can press the *Refresh* button to manually update the statistics.
