# Launch Wizard

The launch wizard is the first window to pop up when opening Geco. It allows you to open an existing stage or create a new one from a set of predefined formats.

## Previous Stages
Geco remembers and displays the list of stages previously opened on your computer.

- To open a previous stage, select it in the list and click the *Open* button.
- Or, you can simply double-click on its name in the list.
- If the stage does not appear in the list (because you just import it from another media),  <img style="float:right; width:32px" src="../images/launcher_folder.png" /> click on the folder button next to the *Path* and select the folder with data; then, click on the *Open* button.

How to spot a folder with stage data? Simple, it contains a file named `geco.prop` as well as multiple CSV files.

## New Stage
Geco lets you create a new stage by giving it a name, choosing a folder, and selecting a format.

- Start by filling in the name.
- When you change your focus, the launcher updates the *Path* field to show the default path to stage data (including the stage name).
- If <img style="float:right; width:32px" src="../images/launcher_folder.png" /> you don't agree with the default path, you can change it by clicking the folder button next to it and create/select another folder. This folder must be **empty**.
- Select a format for the stage.
- Click the *Create* button: Geco will create the files and launch the main window.

The three following formats are available.

- Classic (inline course): controls must be taken in order
- Free Order: runner chooses in which order to take the controls
- Orient'Show: time penalties and MP limit, knockout qualifications,...

A fourth experimental format is available. The format for Raid Orient'Alpin (ROA):

- starts with a Free Order (to scatter runners)
- then switches to a classic course at a given control
- also provides a leg neutralization operation to neutralize rest/shooting sections.
