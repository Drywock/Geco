# Merge Wizard

The *Merge Wizard* allows one to manage card data after a problem arises: unknown ecard, duplicated entry, wrong registered course...

<img src="../images/merge_wizard.png" />

You get the merge wizard when:

- an unregistered ecard is read (manual handler)
- an ecard is read but the runner has some results already (manual handler)
- opening it on the selected runner from the runners table

There are four main actions available from the merge wizard, from top to bottom.

- *Create* an anonymous entry with card data.
- *Close* the wizard and do nothing with the data.
- *Merge* card data into another registered entry.
- *Insert* entry from archive and merge card data into it.

Apart from these actions, the merge wizard displays some information about the card data and provides some tools.

- <img style="float: right; width:28px; margin:0; padding:0;"  src="../images/merge_detect.png" /> You can see the current course, change it, or launch course detection to select the best match. Status and trace will be updated to show the result.

- You can lookup a registered entry incrementally, if you know the runner is registered with another ecard. <img style="float: right; width:22px; margin:0; padding:0;"  src="../images/merge_warning.png" /> Notice how a *warning icon* appears if ever you select an entry which already has data. This means merging ecard data into this entry will **overwrite** previous data (there is no way to come back!).

- <img style="float: right; width:28px; margin:0; padding:0;" src="../images/merge_lookup.png" /> You can lookup incrementally in the archive to insert an unregistered runner directly with ecard data. You can ask Geco to lookup automatically for the ecard number.

*The merge wizard only populates registry and archive boxes on focus. You may have to click twice to pop up the full list.*

## Scenarios

Following are typical use cases for the merge wizard.


### Unknown Ecard (manual handler)

When an unregistered ecard is read, the merge wizard pops up automatically.

- If the runner has been registered but without an ecard number or with an incorrect ecard number, lookup/select him in the *registry* box and *merge*. You are done!
- If the runner is unregistered, lookup/*insert* an entry from the archive or simply *create* an anonymous runner. You can edit runner information in the table.
- *Close* simply discards card data


### Existing Data for Runner (manual handler)

*This matches the Duplicate status with auto handler.*

When an ecard is read and the linked runner already has card data, the merge wizard pops up automatically. The linked runner is selected by default in the *registry* box.

- If you have read again the card to overwrite previously read data, just *merge* the data.
- If the runner is different (two runners using the same ecard), *create* an anonymous entry, *insert* from archive, or *merge* with another registered runner.
- *Close* simply discards card data.


### Merge Registered Entries

You previously choose to create an anonymous entry for an unknown ecard. Then you found the registered runner which should be linked with card data. You now want to merge the card data with the registered runner (instead of copying runner data by hand).

1. Select the anonymous runner with the new card data, then open the merge wizard from the *Runner* pane.
1. Lookup and select the registered runner in the registry box.
1. *Merge* data to finish the action.
1. Confirm or cancel the deletion of the anonymous entry (now a partial duplicate of the other entry).

Other actions also take effect:

- *Create/Insert* will duplicate card data into a new entry
- *Close* just exits the wizard.
