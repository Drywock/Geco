# Toolbar


<img src="../images/toolbar.png" />

The toolbar offers global actions.

- *New/Open* opens the [Launcher](index.html)
- *Save* saves current data on disk. Note that data are [backuped and saved](../howtos/index.html) automatically when you exit and at regular intervals
- *Previous stage/Next stage* navigate to the indicated stage in qualifications. Only available if current stage is detected as part of qualifications
- *Recheck OK|MP* resets all status and all official times for runners with OK or MP status, to be used when a problem affecting all runners has been detected and fixed.
Be careful with this action as it will also discard manual modification to race time you may have made.

In addition, the toolbar lets you control the state of the Sportident reader station.

The underneath button indicates that the reader is off. Click it to start the reader and accepts card reading.

While Geco is launching the reader, the toolbar will display a *Starting...* button. Errors are displayed in the status bar. You can click on the button to interrupt the launch.
