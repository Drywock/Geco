# Toolbar


<img src="../images/toolbar.png" />

The toolbar offers global actions.

- *New/Open* opens the [Launcher](index.html)
- *Save* saves current data on disk. Note that data are [backuped and saved](../howtos/index.html) automatically when you exit and at regular intervals
- *Previous stage/Next stage* navigate to the indicated stage in qualifications. Only available if current stage is detected as part of qualifications
- *Recheck OK|MP* resets all status and all official times for runners with OK or MP status, to be used when a problem affecting all runners has been detected and fixed.
Be careful with this action as it will also discard manual modification to race time you may have made.

The two following buttons manage [Live](../howtos/live.html) features.

In addition, the toolbar lets you control the behavior of Geco when reading e-cards.

The left-most button controls the [Auto](../howtos/index.html) mode of Geco (by default it is enabled). The middle-one controls auto-printing of split times when a runner downloads his e-card. The right-most one controls the e-card reader station.

When disabled, Auto mode and Split printing each display a grey icons:
