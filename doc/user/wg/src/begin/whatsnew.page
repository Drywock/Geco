# What's new?

## Version 2.3 (2015/01/xx)

Geco 2.3 enables the full multi-sections race format (previously Raid Orient'Alpin), fully compatible with other Geco features (course detection, trace display):

- support in-order sections mixing inline and free order controls
- automatically detect section limits when analyzing the trace (ability to manually set section limits when detection goes wrong)
- ability to neutralize a section (subtract section time from race time)
- each control can have a custom time penalty
- ability to manually set a time bonus/malus for each entry
- custom output formats for section splits and results

### Minor Changes

- Push GecoSI 1.2.0 (pCard support)
- Orientshow: <a href="../guide/runners.html#extra">count "extra" controls</a> in trace and add a time penalty for such controls
- Training mode: can choose between copy first or archive insertion for duplicate entries
- Results: a single HTML+O'Splits exports all relevant files at the same time
- Display a brief summary of stage stats in status bar
- Merge dialog: start id can also be searched (thanks yannisgu)
- Wording: rename "Functions" as "Operations" in the Log/Operations tab

### Bug Fix

- More reliable 32 vs 64 bits detection to use the correct SPORTIdent driver
- Training mode: fix bug with duplicate not triggering split printing automatically


## Version 2.2 - 2014/02/06

[Geco 2.2](http://bitbucket.org/sdenier/geco/downloads/geco-2.2.zip) provides faster ecard readouts and introduces course sets, which enables easier handling of [One Man Relay](../workflows/omr.html) events and the like...

- Push [GecoSI](https://github.com/sdenier/GecoSI) to 1.1.0, which enables faster and more reliable readouts for Si6/6*/10/11/SIAC
- Introduce course sets, which define group of related courses (for example, variations in a butterfly course)
- Enable results by course sets (for example, to rank runners in a One Man Relay)
- Enable course detection restricted by runner category, based on course sets
- True mass start time can be set up for each course

### Minor Changes

- Course length & climb can be viewed and edited from the course configuration panel
- Course code are immediately displayed next to the course (not yet editable)
- Time are now displayed in 24h00+ format, not in modulo 24h00 format
- Runner panel displays more details about time computation (start time, before/after neutralization)
- One-click export for [O'Splits](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/osplits/kfnlllbjdagblbcdnmghcljobdlaoaii/details?hl=fr)
- More robust parsing for station log and ecard log (trim field quotes, skip bad record)
- Raise popup to better inform user when the master station notifies a fatal error
- Enable page format setup for multi-columns ticket

*The ROA configuration is disabled in 2.2, prelude to the next version with full sections management.*

### Bug Fix

- GecoSI 1.1.0 integration fixes a bug when reading empty ecards.


## Version 2.1 - 2013/09/21

[Geco 2.1](http://bitbucket.org/sdenier/geco/downloads/geco-2.1.zip) is the first stable release in the 2.x series. It includes the first stable version of GecoSI (1.0.0) as well as a new template engine to export results.

- [GecoSI](https://github.com/sdenier/GecoSI) 1.0.0 can read all SPORTident cards (from Si5 to Si11/SIAC) with the *extended protocol*. It also supports the 192 punches mode for Si6 cards. Geco handles registered starttimes as well as starttime given by start station. GecoSI correctly handles punch times for races which go past midnight, even those lasting more than 24 hours.
- Ranking, splits, runner splits are now generated using [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io). Thus templates can be fully [edited and customized](../howtos/customresults.html) by the user. See for example the custom template for the [O'Splits](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/osplits/kfnlllbjdagblbcdnmghcljobdlaoaii?hl=fr) analysis extension.

### Minor Changes

- A startlist by course can now be exported from the runners table.
- One can choose the file and path for automatic export of results.
- A manual merge between two entries puts the focus on the resulting entry.

### Bug Fix

- GecoSI 1.0.0 integration fixes multiple bugs when reading ecards without start times or when using the 192 punches mode.

### Known Issue

- Ecard reading can be slow for some generation of ecards. The master station may also freeze if the runner removes the ecard too fast (before the bip).


## Version 2.0 beta - 2013/05/01

[Geco 2.0](http://bitbucket.org/sdenier/geco/downloads/geco-2.0-beta1.jar) introduces a new period in Geco history, with a policy to produce smaller releases in shorter cycles. This first 2.x release primarily provides some big changes under the hood.

- Geco can now read all SPORTident cards Si5 through Si11/Siac, thanks to its new [GecoSI library](http://github.com/sdenier/GecoSI).
- The CSV files supporting persistence in Geco 1.x are now deprecated and have been replaced by the more extensible JSON format.

Other minor changes include:

- Refresh serial ports on pop-up (you can hot plug a SPORTident station and see it in Geco).
- Create OE CSV startlists with a [custom course field](../workflows/register.html) for each runner.
- Export [heats startlist](../guide/heats.html) as custom OE CSV format.


##Version 1.3 - 2012/11/05

[Geco 1.3](http://bitbucket.org/sdenier/geco/downloads/geco-1.3.zip) builds upon its course detection algorithm to provide more abilities for course management. Especially some new features provide a better support for training (training mode, import of ecard logs).

### Main changes

- [3 modes](../guide/ecard_modes.html) when reading ecards:
    - racing (classic mode)
    - training (handle multiple reads for the same ecard with different courses, create one entry per read without asking question)
    - register (handle onsite registration)
- Brand new [merge wizard](../guide/merge.html), replacing the old merge dialog from 1.0
    - displays more information
    - provides course detection
    - incremental search in registry and archive
- Auto course available by default
- Import of XML IOF V3 (beta) course file (OCAD 11...)
- New batch [operations](../guide/operations.html)
    - import station logs and check DNS/Running
    - import ecard logs to recreate a race/training from the master station backup memory
    - export a referee log with all manual modifications
    - delete data

The new [Workflows](../workflows/index.html) section describes how those features work together.

### Enhancements

- add an *Out of Time* status
- updated result format, including pace computation
- updated ticket format, customizable header/footer
- updated CSV result format to provide more data
- XML export of result by course (before only category was available)
- better arrangement for stats
- customizable reading modes (manual/auto/archive lookup)

### Fixed bugs

- Fix OE CSV export for CN, RouteGadget
- Fix import of course file generated by Purple Pen
- and other smaller fixes


##Version 1.2 - 2011/11/30

[Geco 1.2](http://bitbucket.org/sdenier/geco/downloads/geco1.2-571-20111130-demo.zip) is an intermediate release, which nonetheless ships with significant changes.
It paves the way for the future versions of Geco, providing some core changes in the UI and data model.

Here is the list of visible changes.

- Geco now explicitly handles [different formats](features.html) for orienteering races: in particular it adapts the UI to each format (config options, custom tabs...). Current formats include Classic inline, Orient'Show, and Free Order. Raid Orient'Alpin is a custom format but should be considered experimental.
- Reworked [configuration tab](../guide/stage.html) (each configuration item now has its own panel). 
- New [launch wizard](../guide/index.html) which enables to either open an existing stage (from an history of recent stages) or creates a new one for a given format.
- Ecard number is no longer required and can be left empty.
- First german translation by Philipp Walker.
- [LiveMap](../howtos/live.html) calibration updated with an intuitive UI (click on controls and map).
- Import [template](../guide/stage.html) for category+course.
- IOF XML export for results (for RouteGadget and others).
- Some other minor changes in the UI.

Change in data file format: Geco 1.2 will automatically convert 1.1 stage files to the new format. Meaning also that Geco 1.1 can't load a 1.2 stage (don't forget your backups).


##Version 1.1 - 2011/04/05

[Geco 1.1](http://bitbucket.org/sdenier/geco/downloads/geco1.1-383-20110405-demo.zip) is a move from the custom app for Orient'Show to a full-featured app for regular Orienteering events, with many new features and UI improvements.

The big changes:

- easy registration through CSV import and competitors archive
- automatic mode to handle registration from archive when reading unknown e-cards, with course detection from the trace
- split format for printing and export (OE format for RouteGadget...)
- ability to use registered start times instead of a start box
- translation available in french and english (both app and doc)

UI/Usability changes:

- many UI changes
- list serial ports to let user choose. Detect the serial port where the SI box is connected
- hyperlink navigation to quickly focus on an e-card from the shortlog (runners panel)
- more universal and new keybindings

Other changes:

- new status and stats to better manage special cases (competitors still running, unknown and duplicate e-cards for automatic mode)
- new data fields for each competitor: registered start time, archive id for competitor, flag for rented e-card
- a default course can be linked to a category (use when performing registration through CSV or archive)
- introduce Operations to transform batch set of data
- CSV export format for French CN (Classement National) + CN simulation in results
- HTML result files can be styled with CSS
- better handling of files with different charsets across platforms

Architecture/Code:

- `Controls` can register themselves as services and get simple access to each other
- refactoring `ResultBuilder` class and related: split between result builder and result/split exporter
- \[Mac\] update to latest Java Mac revision
- some changes in data files to support 1.1 features


##Version 1.0 - 2010/10/19

Initial [release](https://bitbucket.org/sdenier/geco/downloads/geco1.0-238-20101019-demo.zip).

Geco 1.0 is dedicated to the Orient'Show format. It was released shortly after the <a href="http://www.wcup2010.fr/">World Cup</a> event in Annecy. Take a look at [Maps and Results](http://www.wcup2010.fr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=34&Itemid=66&lang=en) and especially at the trace of the finals using [Geco WebStart](http://www.wcup2010.fr/orientshow/gecows_annecy2010.html).
