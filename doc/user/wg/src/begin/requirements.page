# Requirements

What do you need to run Geco?

- A recent JRE (Java Runtime Environment, version 6+)
- Geco bundle: it includes the application (jar file), some template files, user documentation, native libraries for serial communication (RXTX)
- SportIdent drivers
  - Windows: check sportident website
  - Linux: recent kernels recognize the chip used by SI station, so it's plug'n'play
  - Mac OS X: see the [FAQ](faq.html) for custom install.

To launch Geco, **execute the geco.jar file**. It should opens automatically if your JRE is correctly configured.
