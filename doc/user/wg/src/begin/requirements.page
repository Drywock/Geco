# Requirements

What do you need to run Geco?

- A JRE (Java Runtime Environment, version 6+)
- Geco bundle: it includes the application (jar file), some template files, user documentation, native libraries for serial communication (RXTX)
- SportIdent drivers
  - Windows: check sportident website
  - Mac OS X: see the [FAQ](faq.html) for custom install
  - Linux: if you are lucky, it works out of the box; if not, you are in for some [RXTX](http://rxtx.qbang.org) custom install.
- The SPORTident master station must be set up to use the *extended protocol* in *handshake* mode (no autosend). SiConfig can easily change a station configuration.

To launch Geco, **execute the geco.jar file**. It should opens automatically if your JRE is correctly configured.
