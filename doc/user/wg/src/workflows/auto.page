# Auto handler

The automatic handler in Geco can handle ecard download without pre-registration. It provides **on-the-fly registration** with an up to date archive (if the option is active in the [configuration](../guide/stage.html)). When reading an ecard which is not registered, Geco *looks up the ecard in the archive* and inserts the matching entry in the base. Geco also *detects the course* ran by the competitor from the ecard punches.

The schema shows in <font color="blue">blue</font> the two outcomes which require no operation on your part when reading ecards with auto handler:

- on the left the classic way with **pre-registered** entries;
- on the right the automatic insertion of competitors from **archive**.

Geco also recognizes two different outcomes which require your attention: ecard which can not be found (even in the archive) and ecard already read. For both cases, Geco creates a new entry with ecard data and detect the course, but sets unresolved status Unknown or Duplicate.

These outcomes are shown in <font color="orange">orange</font> in the schema:

- middle left shows the **Duplicate** outcome. It can happen simply if you ask the competitor to read again the ecard, or if a new competitor runs with a previously used ecard;
- middle right shows the **Unknown** outcome. The competitor may have followed onsite registration with a rented ecard. Or the competitor is pre-registered, or in the archive, but his real ecard does not match either because of a typo or because he recently changed it.

Resolve manually these outcomes by following the **<font color="green">green</font>** workflow in the schema. You can edit, delete, [merge](../guide/merge.html) the new entry to *resolve the case*. If you choose to keep and edit the new entry, don't forget to *recheck* (`Mod+R`) or *change* the official status. You can also print splits (`Mod+P`) for the competitor.
