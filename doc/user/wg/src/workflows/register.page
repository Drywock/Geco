# Registration

## Pre-registration of competitors

- You can import a CSV file in OE entry format. It is the fastest way to import many entries.
- You can import competitors from an [archive](../guide/archive.html).
- Both CSV import and archive import automatically create club and category necessary for the import.
- Both CSV import and archive import sets runner's course to the default course for category (if configured).


## Onsite registration

- You can insert a new entry by clicking the `+` button (or pressing `mod+I`) and edit the entry by hand.
- You can use the [register mode](../guide/ecard_modes.html) for onsite registration the day of the stage

## On the fly registration
