Geco is a lightweight application for managing orienteering races.
It is written in Java and designed to be cross-platform.

Geco comes with powerful features designed around its algorithm for automatic course detection: accurate trace, automatic entry before/after the race, race recreation from backup memory...

The Geco UI is designed to provide a lean user experience: navigate through stage workflow using the top tabs, and access data by direct manipulation.

Geco can handle multiple race formats: classic inline, free order, orientshow, multi-sections with time penalties, neutralized legs.


About the 2.3
-------------

Geco 2.3 enables the multi-sections race format, which can mix inline and free order sections, provide time penalties per control, section neutralization, split printing with sections...


Install & Launch
----------------

Unzip the archive file then double-click the jar file.

Geco runs with Java version 6 and above. You can download a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) from http://www.java.com

You need SPORTIdent drivers to read SI cards.

- Windows: download available at http://www.sportident.com/
- Mac OS X: read the [FAQ](http://sdenier.github.io/Geco/begin/faq.html).
- Linux: always a bumpy ride. Take your chance but no guarantee it will work out of the box.


User documentation
------------------

Available under the `help/` folder in html format.

If you are experienced with orienteering softwares, you can jump-start using the application without the doc. Geco UI is designed to be usable: almost any available action is visible, data accessible through direct manipulation, no hidden menus, no complicated workflow.
